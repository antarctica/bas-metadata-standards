            <h2>Metadata standards and profiles</h2>
            <p>Metadata <em>standards</em> and <em>profiles</em> explain how to describe a resource such that it can be
                understood, unambiguously, by others.</p>

            <p>An <em>abstract standard</em> describes an information model. A <em>concrete implementation</em> describes
                how to implement an abstract model, such as using XML. There are relatively few standards usually made by
                international bodies such as ISO.</p>

            <p>A metadata <em>profile</em>, applies on top of a metadata standard and is focused on a particular topic
                discipline or other initiative. Profiles can restrict which elements in a standard may be used, make
                optional elements mandatory, add or restrict options for elements with controlled values and provide
                guidance on which elements and values to use in different situations.</p>
            <p> There are a large range of profiles from different groups such as national and international standards
                bodies, discipline or location specific groups and large collaborative projects.</p>
            <p>Profile's cannot make mandatory elements in the standard they apply to, optional (i.e. a profile can
                only be restrictive, not permissive).</p>

        <section id="validation">
            <h3>Metadata validation</h3>
            <p>To ensure compliance, metadata standards and profiles typically include a means to programmatically check
                records contain:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>any required elements</li>
                <li>any required/controlled element values</li>
                <li>elements in the correct order</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Metadata standards typically use schemas and schematrons to determine if a record is valid:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>a <em>schema</em> checks the structure of elements in a record</li>
                <li>a <em>schematron</em> checks specific elements in a record using a series of rules and patterns</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Notably a schematron can be use conditional logic, such as to ensure an element is included when certain
                conditions are met.</p>
            <p>Some standards or profiles provide a validation service with a user interface and/or API for validating
                records.</p>
