## IEC (PAS) 61174

Full citation:

> Maritime navigation and radiocommunication equipment and systems – Electronic chart display and information system
> (ECDIS) – Operational and performance requirements, methods of testing and required test results

This standard consists of several parts/revisions (listed here in chronological order):

* *IEC 61174:2015* (RTZ 1.0) - original standard
* *IEC PAS 61174:2021* (RTZ 1.2) - standard revision

Changes between *IEC 61174:2015* and *IEC PAS 61174:2021* are:

> This PAS has been developed to improve interoperability between equipment implementing route plan exchange format by
> addressing issues uncovered in the original RTZ specification (Annex S of IEC 61174:2015), and in recognition of the
> fact that some manufacturers have identified a pressing business need to implement an improved and expanded version
> of the RTZ format.

Though not an international standard, IEC 61174 is an industry standard, defining both an information model and several encodings used by most equipment manufactures. These encodings are:

* *RTZ* - Route Plan Exchange (XML encoding)
* *RTZP* - RTZ Package (Zip archive encoding, containing an RTZ file and optional supporting assets)

## Validation

The *IEC 61174* standards family uses [XSD schemas](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-1/) for checking records comply
with the standard.

In addition, there are [JSON Schemas](https://github.com/antarctica/metadata-library#supported-configuration-versions)
for this standard for use in the [BAS Metadata Library](https://github.com/antarctica/metadata-library).

### XSD schemas

* [*IEC 61174:2015* (RTZ 1.0)](https://www.cirm.org/rtz/RTZ%20Schema%20version%201_0.xsd)
* [*IEC PAS 61174:2021* (RTZ 1.2)](https://www.cirm.org/rtz/RTZ%20Schema%20version%201_2.xsd)

The BAS Metadata Library can be used to
[validate records](https://github.com/antarctica/metadata-library#validating-a-record){:.bsk-alert-link} against these
schemas.
