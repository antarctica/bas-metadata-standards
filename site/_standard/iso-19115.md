## ISO 19115

[ISO 19115](https://www.iso.org/standard/26020.html) is a abstract standard for describing geographic data and services.

It consists of several parts/revisions (listed here in chronological order):

* ISO 19115:2003 - original standard, unofficially termed ISO 19115-0
* ISO 19115-2:2009 - extension to original standard, adding acquisition and processing related concepts

There are now newer version of these standards, specifically ISO 19115-1:2014 and ISO 19115-2:2019. Work is ongoing
within BAS / UK PDC to migrate to these standards (last updated 2021).

## ISO 19139

[ISO 19139](https://www.iso.org/standard/32557.html) is an encoding in XML of the ISO 19115 standard.

It consists of several parts/revisions (listed here in chronological order):

* ISO 19139:2007 - encoding of ISO 19115:2003 in XML
* ISO 19139-2:2012 - encoding of ISO 19115-2:2009 in XML

## Profiles

There are various profiles for ISO 19115 that constrain its use for interoperability within various initiatives.

Profiles used in BAS / UK PDC are:

* [EU INSPIRE](/profile/inspire)
* [UK PDC Discovery](/profile/uk-pdc-discovery)

## Vocabularies

ISO 19115 defines a number of code lists used as controlled vocabularies. It also supports various types of descriptive
keyword for including terms from other vocabularies.

* [Code lists for ISO 19915:2003](http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/ISO_19139_Schemas/resources/codelist/gmxCodelists.xml)

Wherever possible, ISO 19915:2003 code lists and values are used. However in some cases, code lists and code list
values from ISO 19115-1:2014 are used. This is only used where necessary, such as to include 'released' dates, which
otherwise cannot be expressed using ISO 19915:2003 code lists.

* [Code lists for ISO 19115-1:2014](https://standards.iso.org/iso/19115/resources/Codelists/cat/codelists.xml)

## Validation

* ISO 19139:2007
  * [schemas](https://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/ISO_19139_Schemas/)

## XML stylesheets

### ISO XML to HTML

The [ISO 19115 to HTML](https://service.ncddc.noaa.gov/rdn/www/metadata-standards/metadata-xml/documents/ISOxml2html.zip)
stylesheet, from the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI), presents metadata in a more readable form
than raw XML. This stylesheet is useful for reviewing the contents, rather than technical structure of an XML record.

This stylesheet supports both the `19115:2003` and `19115-2:2009` standards, when encoded using `ISO 19139:2007` and
`ISO 19139-2:2012`.

A copy of this stylesheet is available from this website at:

```

```

### ISO 19139:2007 rubric

The [SpiralTracker report](https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/metadata/published/xsl/isoRubricHTML.xsl) stylesheet, from the
National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI), assesses the quality of a metadata record in various areas.

This stylesheet supports both the `19115:2003` and `19115-2:2009` standards, when encoded using `ISO 19139:2007` and
`ISO 19139-2:2012`.
