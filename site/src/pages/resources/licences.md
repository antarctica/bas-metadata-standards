# Licences

{% include 'toc.html' %}

Licences state how a resource may, or may not, be used. For example, that resources may be copied but not for 
commercial purposes.

> [!TIP]
> BAS authored open-access resources should normally use the 
> [Open Government Licence](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/) (OGL).

## Local licences

A set of local licences are registered for use within BAS where a resource cannot be shared publicly, or used freely.

> [!NOTE]
> These local licences are only intended for use with resources included in the 
> [BAS Data Catalogue](https://data.bas.ac.uk).
