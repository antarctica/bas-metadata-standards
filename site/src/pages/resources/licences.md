# Licences

{% include 'toc.html' %}

Licences state how a resource may, or may not, be used. For example, that resources may be copied but not for 
commercial purposes.

> [!TIP]
> BAS authored open-access resources should normally use the 
> [Open Government Licence](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/) (OGL).

> [!WARNING]
> A local licence limiting who and how a resource can be shared and used MUST be used for resources containing 
> sensitive information that cannot be shared publicly.

## Local licences

A set of local licences are registered for use within BAS where a resource cannot be shared publicly, or used freely.

> [!WARNING]
> These local licences are intended for use within metadata records included in the BAS Data Catalogue. They may be 
> used by others for other purposes if useful, but may be changed or removed at any time.

### All Rights Reserved (v1)

[Licence Text](https://metadata-resources.data.bas.ac.uk/licences/all-rights-reserved-v1/)

This licence represents the default state of copyright and does not grant a user any rights or permissions to use an item. 

It is the most restrictive licence we can assign (separate to limiting access to the item).

### Operations Mapping (v1)

> This licence is replaced by the 'MAGIC Products' licence and is no longer recommended for use in new works.
