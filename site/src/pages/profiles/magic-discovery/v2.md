> The terms 'resource record' and 'container record' are used according to the [Record Super Type](https://github.com/antarctica/lantern/blob/v0.5.0/docs/data-model.md#item-super-types) concept from the BAS Data Catalogue.

## Rational

The base ISO 19115 requirements are very minimal and not sufficient to meet MAGIC's needs for resource discovery, including:

- ensuring records comply with the [BAS Data Catalogue Record Requirements](https://github.com/antarctica/lantern/blob/v0.4.0/docs/data-model.md#record-requirements)
- ensuring [Esri item metadata](https://gitlab.data.bas.ac.uk/MAGIC/add/-/issues/244) (internal URL) can be derived from records, to prevent inconsistency and repeated effort
- ensuring access and usage constraints are captured, as MAGIC routinely handles sensitive, licensed or otherwise restricted information
- ensuring minimal information is available to enable future editing workflows (progress and status)
- ensuring a minimal level of data quality information is captured (lineage information)

In essence, this profile aims to provide a higher floor for record completeness, to ensure a minimal level of utility.

## Base standard

This profile is based on:

- the [ISO 19115-2:2009](/standards/iso-19115-19139#iso-19115) standard
- the [BAS Data Catalogue Record Requirements](https://github.com/antarctica/lantern/blob/v0.4.0/docs/data-model.md#record-requirements)

## Related profiles

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a preemptive link.

In most cases, records will also follow the 
[MAGIC Administration](/profiles/magic-administration/latest) 
profile to set administrative metadata.

## Changes from previous edition

Previous edition: [1 (2025-06-14 revision)](/profiles/magic-discovery/v1).

### Breaking changes

- restricting allowed progress code (req. 11) values to 'completed' and 'underDevelopment' only
- added new citation requirement (req. 15)
- added new copyright holder requirement (req. 16)

### Major changes

- domain consistency (req. 02) changed to reflect edition 2
- including 'initiative', 'feature' and 'fieldSession' as allowed hierarchy levels (req. 03)
- access constraints (req. 09) changed from authoritative to informative (administrative metadata is now authoritative)

### Other changes

- editorial tweaks to improve clarity and align with other profiles
- splitting edition from profile in URLs to better support multiple historic versions
- linking to publicly accessible documentation where possible
- adding cross-reference to administrative metadata profile
- corrected mistake in publication date (req. 07) profile obligation (was 'mandatory' should be 'conditional')
- corrected mistake in publication date (req. 07) profile occurrence (was '1' should be '0..1')
- corrected mistake in lineage statement (req. 13) profile obligation (was 'mandatory' should be 'conditional')
- corrected mistake in lineage statement (req. 13) profile occurrence (was '1' should be '0..1')
- corrected mistake in geographic extent (req. 14) profile obligation (was 'mandatory' should be 'conditional')
- corrected mistake in geographic extent (req. 14) profile occurrence (was '1' should be '0..1')
- removed confusing authorisation justification in usage constraints (req. 10)

extension as indicated):

- 'collection'
- 'dataset'
- 'feature'
- 'fieldSession'
- 'initiative'
- 'product'
- 'paperMapProduct' (local extension)
- 'series'

> [!NOTE]
> Required as other requirements are conditional based on the resource type, which is expressed by this element.

### Requirement 04 - Catalogue Identifier

Records MUST include an identifier element, identifying the resource within the BAS Data Catalogue.

This identifier MUST use these values:

- value: the value of [Requirement 01 - File Identifier](#requirement-01---file-identifier)
- URL: the Catalogue item URL for the record, in the form: `https://data.bas.ac.uk/items/{file_identifier}`
- namespace: 'data.bas.ac.uk'

> [!NOTE]
> Required to comply with technical requirements within the BAS Data Catalogue (to ensure records are within scope of the catalogue).

### Requirement 05 - Edition

Records MUST include an edition within the resource citation element, using a value that MUST be unique across all editions of a resource series.

> [!NOTE]
> Required to distinguish versions/editions of a resource without relying on descriptive elements, such as title (which may not be unique).

### Requirement 06 - Released Date

Published resources MUST include a released date within the resource citation element of the record.

The released date value MAY be in the past (in which case the resource is deemed 'released'), or the future (and deemed 'under embargo').

Draft records MAY include a released date if desired.

> [!NOTE]
> Required to comply with technical requirements within the BAS Data Catalogue (for embargo management).

### Requirement 07 - Publication Date

Published resources MUST include a publication date, with a value in the past, within the resource citation element of the record.

Draft records MAY include a publication date with a value in the future (i.e. if the publication date is known). They MUST NOT use a date in the past, as they will be considered published.

> [!NOTE]
> Required to comply with technical requirements within the BAS Data Catalogue (for publication management).

### Requirement 08 - Point of Contact

Records MUST include MAGIC as a contact using the 'Point of Contact' role, within the resource citation element.

The contact value MUST be as per [Appendix 2 - MAGIC Point of Contact Element](#appendix-2---magic-point-of-contact-element).

> [!NOTE]
> Required to comply with technical requirements within the BAS Data Catalogue (for item enquiries).

### Requirement 09 - Access Constraints

Records MUST include an access constraint, indicating who can access the resource.

> [!WARNING]
> This information MUST be considered informative only. It MUST NOT be used by data access systems for example. 

> [!NOTE]
> Required to explain who can access the resource to end-users where authoritative administrative metadata is unavailable.

### Requirement 10 - Usage Constraints

Records MUST include a usage constraint, indicating the licence under which the resource can be used.

> [!NOTE]
> Required to ensure licencing requirements for resources are passed onto end-users.

### Requirement 11 - Progress Code

> [!TIP]
> Requirement revised for edition 2 (terms restricted).

Records MUST include a progress code for both the resource and record, using one of these allowed options from the 
ISO 19115 'MD_ProgressCode' code list:

- 'completed'
- 'underDevelopment'

> [!NOTE]
> Required to enable future internal metadata management workflows.

### Requirement 12 - Update Frequency Code

Records MUST include an update frequency code for both the resource and record, using a value from the 'ISO 19115 MD_MaintenanceFrequencyCode' code list.

> [!NOTE]
> Required to enable future internal metadata management workflows.

### Requirement 13 - Lineage Statement

Non-collection records MUST include a lineage statement element describing the origins and sources used to create the resource.

Container record types MAY include this element if desired.

> [!NOTE]
> MAGIC internal QA requirement.

### Requirement 14 - Geographic Extent

Records MUST include a bounding box element defining the geographic extent of the resource, with an extent identifier of 'bounding'.

Records MAY include additional extents (with geographic and/or temporal and/or vertical components) as desired.

> [!NOTE]
> Required to enable future spatial search features.

## Requirement 15 - Citation

> [!TIP]
> New requirement for edition 2.

Non-collection records MUST include a citation statement element describing how users must attribute the resource.

Container record types MAY include this element if desired.

> [!NOTE]
> Required to ensure users can comply with resources licensed under attribution-required licences.

## Requirement 16 - Copyright Holder

> [!TIP]
> New requirement for edition 2.

Records MUST include a contact using the 'rightsHolder' role (ISO 19115 'CI_RoleCode' code list).

> [!NOTE]
> Required to ensure the copyright holders of resources are passed onto end-users.
