> [!NOTE]
> Terms including 'MUST', 'SHOULD', 'MAY' etc. are used according to [RFC 2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119).
>
> The terms 'resource record' and 'container record' are used according to the [Record Super Type](https://github.com/antarctica/lantern/blob/v0.5.0/docs/data-model.md#item-super-types) concept from the BAS Data Catalogue.

## Rational

The base ISO 19115 requirements are very minimal and not sufficient to meet MAGIC's needs for resource discovery, including:

- ensuring records comply with the [BAS Data Catalogue Record Requirements](https://github.com/antarctica/lantern/blob/v0.4.0/docs/data-model.md#record-requirements)
- ensuring [Esri item metadata](https://gitlab.data.bas.ac.uk/MAGIC/add/-/issues/244) (internal URL) can be derived from records, to prevent inconsistency and repeated effort
- ensuring access and usage constraints are captured, as MAGIC routinely handles sensitive and/or licensed information
- ensuring minimal information is available to enable future editing workflows
- ensuring minimal information is captured for data ownership and quality

In essence, this profile aims to provide a higher floor for record completeness, to ensure a useful level of utility.

## Base standard

This profile is based on:

- the [ISO 19115-2:2009](/standards/iso-19115-19139#iso-19115) standard
- the [BAS Data Catalogue Record Requirements](https://github.com/antarctica/lantern/blob/v0.4.0/docs/data-model.md#record-requirements)

## Related profiles

In most cases, records will also follow the [MAGIC Administrative](/profiles/magic-administrative/latest) profile.

## Changes from previous edition

Previous edition: [1 (2025-06-14 revision)](/profiles/magic-discovery/v1).

### Breaking changes

- restricting progress code values to a limited subset (req. 11)
- added new citation requirement (req. 15)
- added new copyright holder requirement (req. 16)

### Major changes

- domain consistency changed to reflect edition 2 (req. 02) 
- allowing additional hierarchy levels (req. 03):
    - 'initiative'
    - 'feature'
    - 'fieldSession'
    - 'mapProduct' (local extension)
    - 'webMapProduct' (local extension)
- access constraints changed from authoritative to informative (administrative metadata is now authoritative) (req. 09)
- access and usage constraints extended to cover the resource and metadata (req. 09 & 10)

### Other changes

- editorial tweaks to improve clarity and align with other profiles
- splitting edition from profile in URLs to better support multiple historic versions
- linking to publicly accessible documentation where possible
- adding cross-reference to administrative metadata profile
- corrected mistake in released date profile obligation (was 'mandatory' should be 'conditional') (req. 06)
- corrected mistake in released date profile occurrence (was '1' should be '0..1') (req. 06)
- corrected mistake in publication date profile obligation (was 'mandatory' should be 'conditional') (req. 07)
- corrected mistake in publication date profile occurrence (was '1' should be '0..1') (req. 07)
- corrected mistake in lineage statement profile obligation (was 'mandatory' should be 'conditional') (req. 13)
- corrected mistake in lineage statement profile occurrence (was '1' should be '0..1') (req. 13)
- corrected mistake in geographic extent profile obligation (was 'mandatory' should be 'conditional') (req. 14)
- corrected mistake in geographic extent profile occurrence (was '1' should be '0..1') (req. 14)
- removed confusing authorisation justification in usage constraints (req. 10)

- 'initiative'
- 'product'
    - 'mapProduct' (local extension)
        - 'paperMapProduct' (local extension)
        - 'webMapProduct' (local extension)
- 'series'

> [!NOTE]
> Required as other requirements are conditional based on the resource type, which is expressed by this element.

### Requirement 04 - Catalogue Identifier

Records MUST include an identifier element, identifying the resource within the BAS Data Catalogue.

This identifier MUST use these values:

- value: the value of [Requirement 01 - File Identifier](#requirement-01-file-identifier)
- URL: the Catalogue item URL for the record, in the form: `https://data.bas.ac.uk/items/{file_identifier}`
- namespace: 'data.bas.ac.uk'

> [!NOTE]
> Required to comply with technical requirements within the BAS Data Catalogue.

### Requirement 05 - Edition

Records MUST include an edition, using a value that MUST be unique across all editions of a chronological series.

> [!NOTE]
> Required to distinguish versions/editions of a resource series without relying on descriptive elements, such as title 
> (which may not be unique).

### Requirement 06 - Released Date

> [!TIP]
> Requirement revised in this edition (clarification of requirements).

Records for published resources (as determined by [Requirement 07 - Publication Date](#requirement-07-publication-date)) 
MUST include a released date.

The released date value MAY be in the past (in which case the resource is deemed 'released'), or the future 
(and deemed 'under embargo').

Unpublished records MAY include a released date if desired.

> [!NOTE]
> Required to comply with technical requirements within the BAS Data Catalogue.

### Requirement 07 - Publication Date

Records for published resources MUST include a publication date, with a value in the past.

Unpublished records MAY include a publication date with a value in the future (i.e. in advance of publication) but MUST 
NOT use a date in the past, as they will be considered published.

> [!NOTE]
> Required to comply with technical requirements within the BAS Data Catalogue.

### Requirement 08 - Point of Contact

Records MUST include MAGIC as a contact with the 'pointOfContact' role (from the ISO 19115 'CI_RoleCode' code list).

The contact value MUST be as per [Appendix 2 - MAGIC Point of Contact Element](#appendix-2-magic-point-of-contact-element).

> [!NOTE]
> Required to comply with technical requirements within the BAS Data Catalogue.

### Requirement 09 - Access Constraints

> [!TIP]
> Requirement revised in this edition (no longer authoritative, required for resource and metadata).

Records MUST include an access constraint, indicating who can access:

- the resource
- the metadata (record) describing the resource

> [!WARNING]
> This information MUST only be considered informative. It MUST NOT be used by data access systems for example. 

> [!NOTE]
> Required to explain who can access the metadata, and the resource (in a general sense).

### Requirement 10 - Usage Constraints

> [!TIP]
> Requirement revised in this edition (required for resource and metadata).

Records MUST include a usage constraint, stating the licence under which:

- the resource can be used
- the metadata (record) can be used

> [!NOTE]
> Required to explain how the metadata, and the resource, can and cannot be used.

### Requirement 11 - Progress Code

> [!TIP]
> Requirement revised in this edition (options restricted).

Records MUST include a progress code for the resource, using one of these allowed options from the ISO 19115 
'MD_ProgressCode' code list:

- 'completed'
- 'deprecated'
- 'onGoing'
- 'retired'
- 'superseded'
- 'underDevelopment'

> [!NOTE]
> Required to enable future internal metadata management workflows.

### Requirement 12 - Update Frequency Code

Records MUST include an update frequency code for the resource, using a value from the ISO 19115 
'MD_MaintenanceFrequencyCode' code list.

> [!NOTE]
> Required to enable future internal metadata management workflows.

### Requirement 13 - Lineage Statement

Resource record types MUST include a lineage statement describing the origins of the resource.

Container record types MAY include a lineage statement if desired.

> [!NOTE]
> MAGIC QC requirement.

### Requirement 14 - Geographic Extent

Records MUST include an extent, with 'bounding' as an identifier, containing at least a geographic bounding box for the 
resource.

Records MAY include additional extent components (e.g. temporal), and/or other extents.

> [!NOTE]
> Required to enable future spatial search features.

### Requirement 15 - Citation

> [!TIP]
> New requirement in this edition.

Resource record types MUST include a citation element, explaining how users should cite the resource.

Container record types MAY include this element.

> [!NOTE]
> Required for end-users to comply with licences requiring attribution.

### Requirement 16 - Copyright Holder
