# ISO 19115/19139

{% include 'toc.html' %}

> [!TIP]
> This standards family is recommended for all discovery metadata.

> [!NOTE]
> A subset of this standards family is supported by the 
> [BAS Metadata Library](https://github.com/antarctica/metadata-library?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-standards).

## ISO 19115

The *ISO 19115* standards family describes geographic resources, such as datasets, products and services. ISO 19115 is 
an abstract standard, defining an information model only.

It consists of several parts/revisions (listed here in chronological order):

- ISO 19115:2003 - base standard (unofficially termed ISO 19115-0 in this website)
- ISO 19115-2:2009 - extension to base standard, adding acquisition and processing related concepts

> [!NOTE]
> BAS has purchased copies of these standards. Contact the [UK PDC](mailto:pdcservicedesk@bas.ac.uk) for more information.

There are successor parts/revisions to this standard under review (and not currently supported):

- ISO 19115-1:2014 - successor to ISO 19115:2003
- ISO 19115-2:2019 - successor to ISO 19115-2:2009

## ISO 19139

The *ISO 19139* standards family describes how to encode the 19115 information model using XML. ISO 19139 is a standard 
encoding, consisting of XML schemas, schematrons and transformations (XLSTs).

It consists of several parts/revisions (listed here in chronological order):

- ISO 19139:2007 - encoding of ISO 19115:2003 in XML
- ISO 19139-2:2012 - encoding of ISO 19115-2:2009 in XML

> [!NOTE]
> BAS has purchased copies of these standards. Contact the [UK PDC](mailto:pdcservicedesk@bas.ac.uk) for more information.

There are successor parts/revisions to these standard under review (and not currently supported):

- ISO 19139-1:2019 - successor to 19139:2007

There are additional related parts to this standard under review (and not currently supported):

- ISO 19115-3:2019

## Profiles

There are various profiles for the *ISO 19115* standards family that constrain its use for interoperability within 
various initiatives.

Examples of profiles defined by external organisations:

- [EU INSPIRE](https://knowledge-base.inspire.ec.europa.eu/overview_en)
- [UK GEMINI](https://agiorguk.github.io/gemini/)

Profiles defined within BAS:

- [MAGIC Discovery Metadata](https://metadata-standards.data.bas.ac.uk/profiles/magic-discovery-v1)

## Vocabularies

The ISO 19115 standards family uses controlled vocabularies for two concepts:

- code lists
- descriptive keywords

### Code lists

Code lists defined controlled lists of values for specific properties, such as date types (created, updated, etc.). 
ISO publish official code lists for both *19115:2003* and its successor *19115:2014*:

- [Code lists for ISO 19915:2003](http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/ISO_19139_Schemas/resources/codelist/gmxCodelists.xml)
- [Code lists for ISO 19115-1:2014](https://standards.iso.org/iso/19115/resources/Codelists/cat/codelists.xml)

> [!NOTE]
> BAS records use both these lists for different elements, as the latter are more expansive and provide critically 
> needed values, such as 'released' for describing resource embargo's.

### Descriptive keywords

There are a number of descriptive keywords that can be used within records, including:

- international or regional vocabularies maintained by an external authority such as [NASA](https://gcmd.earthdata.nasa.gov/static/kms/)
- organisational vocabularies maintained locally such as [BAS Research Topics](https://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/T01/current/)
- free-text, uncontrolled, terms specific to each resource

> [!NOTE]
> Keywords can describe a number of different aspects, such as topics, places, providers, etc.

## Validation

The *ISO 19115* standards family uses two methods for checking records comply with the standard:

- [XSD schemas](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-1/)
- [Schematrons](https://www.schematron.com/)

### XSD Schemas

XML Schema Definitions (XSDs) for *ISO 19139:2007* are 
[available](https://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/ISO_19139_Schemas/) from ISO.

> [!TIP]
> The BAS Metadata Library can [Validate Records](https://github.com/antarctica/metadata-library#validating-a-record) 
> against these schemas.

> [!NOTE] 
> Constructing a complete validation/dependency chain for these schemas is quite difficult. A set of resolved schemas 
> is available from, and used within, the BAS Metadata Library. 
>
> These schemas are [customised](https://github.com/antarctica/metadata-library/tree/v0.14.0?tab=readme-ov-file#configuration-schemas) 
> to use relative imports and a single version of the GML and GMD schemas.

### Schematrons

XML Schematrons for *ISO 19139:2007* are 
[available](https://github.com/opengeospatial/ets-19139/tree/feature-issue-javadoc/src/main/resources/org/opengis/cite/schematron) 
from the Open Geospatial Commission (OGC). 

> [!WARNING]
> The [BAS Metadata Library](https://github.com/antarctica/metadata-library) does not validate records against these 
> schematrons.

### JSON Schemas

JSON Schemas for the unofficial JSON encoding of ISO 19115 used in the 
[BAS Metadata Library](https://github.com/antarctica/metadata-library) are 
[available](https://github.com/antarctica/metadata-library#supported-configuration-versions) for local validation.

> [!NOTE]
> This JSON encoding is specific to the use of ISO 19115 within BAS. It is not a general purpose, or necessarily 
> correct, encoding and should not be relied on by others.

## XML stylesheets

### ISO HTML

The [ISO 19115 to HTML](https://service.ncddc.noaa.gov/rdn/www/metadata-standards/metadata-xml/documents/ISOxml2html.zip) 
stylesheet from the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI), presents metadata in a more readable form 
than raw XML, whilst reflecting the structure and property names of the ISO 19115 data model.

> [!NOTE]
> This stylesheet supports both ISO 19115:2003 and ISO 19115-2:2009.


A copy of this stylesheet is available from:

```
https://metadata-resources.data.bas.ac.uk/xml-stylesheets/iso-html/xml-to-html-ISO.xsl
```

To use this stylesheet in an ISO 19115 record:

```xml
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>
<?xml-stylesheet type="text/xsl" href="https://metadata-resources.data.bas.ac.uk/xml-stylesheets/iso-html/xml-to-html-ISO.xsl"?>
<gmi:MI_Metadata>...</gmi:MI_Metadata>
```

### ISO Rubric

The [SpiralTracker Report](https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/metadata/published/xsl/isoRubricHTML.xsl) stylesheet, from the 
National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI), assesses the quality of a metadata record against various 
measures, including discoverability.

> This stylesheet supports both ISO 19115:2003 and ISO 19115-2:2009.
