Corrections:

* Curator is custodian

For discussion:

* Ordering of authors

* Supporting a mixture of authors/originators and collaborators - the former for those in a citation (possibly for the 
paper not for dataset), the latter for others involved in a dataset but not part of the citation.

* For dates, 'Creation' date is required by PyCSW for translation to Dublin Core (could be instead of, or as well as,
  'Published' date)

Decisions:

* Our full name is: "UK Polar Data Centre, Natural Environment Research Council, UK Research &amp; Innovation."

* Our short name is: "UK Polar Data Centre" 

* For the PDC as a responsible party, we don't have a position, just an organisational name (see below)

* File references will change to UUIDs when possible

* Copyright - talk to Katy about NERC policy
